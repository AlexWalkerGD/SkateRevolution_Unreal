# SkateSystem

This project is a demonstration of a single-player skateboarding system where players can explore environments and perform basic tricks like jumping, providing a fun and dynamic experience.

## Features
- Simple Movement and Jumping: Players can skate around the environment using basic movement keys and jump with the spacebar.
- Dynamic Trick System: While the focus is on basic movement, the system can be expanded for more tricks in the future.

## How to Play
1. Move Around: Use the movement keys (W, A, S, D) to skate around the environment.
2. Jump: Press the spacebar to jump over obstacles and perform simple tricks.
